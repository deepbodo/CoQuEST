Beckett : Enver Kotta, convictions for armed robbery, assault and possession.  Ryan : According to the case file, Logan's mom either had the bad sense  Ryan : to let Enver stash his cocaine at her apartment,  Ryan : or she was in on the whole drug operation. The bottom line is, Logan got sick of it and called the cops.  Ryan : Logan's mom ended up getting seven years, while Enver did five.  Beckett : Let me guess. Enver cut a deal, threw her under the bus.  Ryan : Yep. And guess what else? Enver just got out on parole last month.  Castle : So when he realized Logan was in town, he went looking for payback.  Esposito : Hey. So it looks like Logan definitely had contact with this guy. Turns out that Enver was a regular  Esposito : at that social club where the calls came from.  Beckett : - Okay, let's pick him up. - Yeah.  Enver Kotta : Whatever happened to that kid, I had nothing to do with it.  Beckett : You served five years because of Logan.  Beckett : It was no secret that you wanted him to pay.  Esposito : Is that why you called him?  Esposito : To let him know what you were gonna do to him?  Enver : I didn't kill Logan.  Beckett : Then where were you last night between 3 : 00 and 4 : 00 a.m.? Let me help you out, Enver. Your credit card puts you at a diner at 1 : 15 a.m., where a witness saw you with Logan. That same witness said that when Logan left, you followed him out. A few hours later, Logan was dead."}

Chase : Once we isolate what's causing your allergy,  Chase : then we can be a little more lax. I-I can pray with you. I don't wanna die.  Augustine : Why has he left me? I was in seminary school. They asked us once what our favorite passage was. I chose First Peter, chapter one, verse seven. \"These trials only test your faith to see whether or not it is strong and pure. Your faith is being tested, as fire tests gold and purifies it\".  Augustine : \"And your faith is far more precious to the Lord than mere gold. \"So if your faith remains strong after being tested, \"it will bring you much praise and glory and honor...  Augustine : on the day of his return\". He hasn't left you. The only thing in the way of you knowing he's there is your fear. You have a choice... faith or fear. That's the test."}
